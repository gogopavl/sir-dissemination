'''SIR diffusion process in an aggregated network. The process begins with a set of infected nodes, rather than a single one. 
Returns the size of the outbreak, i.e. the number of infected and recovered nodes. 
If all infected nodes recover before the process ends, then only the number of recovered is returned.'''
